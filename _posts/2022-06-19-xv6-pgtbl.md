- Speeding up system calls: Straightforward task. Store a pointer to *struct usyscall* in proc.h.
Allocate a page and assign the PA of that page to the pointer. Add the requisite mappings in *proc_pagetable*

- Print a pagetable: Again, straightorward task. Your method would be very similar to the *walk* function.
About 95% similar.

- Detecting which pages have been accessed: First read the privileged ISA document to find out how the Access bit 
is modified (grep for it). The *pgaccess* syscall is similar to other syscalls in how the args are parsed. 
In *pgaccess* impl, general idea is to find out the leaf PTE and then look at the Access bit, the privileged ISA 
doc has the instructions on how to do that. Find out for each page, the corresponding leaf PTE and get the access bit
and store it in *uint64* bitmask. Transfer this bitmask from kernel to userspace using *copyout*. That's it.
