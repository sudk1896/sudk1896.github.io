I was reading up on Raft, an understandable consensus algorithm. The link to the paper is
[here](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf). Only continue reading if you've read the paper.

Right here ![alt text](https://github.com/sudk1896/sudk1896.github.io/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-11-10%2013-57-44.png "Commitment"),
The paper states that
```
A Log entry is committed once the leader that created the entry has replicated it on a majority of the servers.
```
I misunderstood this statement to assume that whenever an entry is present on a majority of 
the servers, it is committed. This assumption doesn't hold.

On Page-8 of the raft paper and in Figure-8  ![alt text](https://github.com/sudk1896/sudk1896.github.io/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20from%202018-11-10%2014-15-33.png "here"),
In Figure-8.c, It is Term 4 and S1 is leader, even though The entry at Index 2 Term 2 is present on a majority of 
the servers, it is very much possible that that entry can be wiped out as shown in Figure-8.d. In the next Term i.e. term 5 (whenever new leader is elected term increases) S5 could overwrite entries at indices >= 2 with its own Term 3 entry (because of AppendEntries RPC #3)
```
If an existing entry conflicts with a new one(same index but different terms), delete the existing entry and all that follow it.
```
In order for this to not happen, the **leader in the current term** should replicate an entry that it received in the 
**current term** on a **majority** of the servers. In our case, S1 needs to replicate the entry it received in Term 4 on a majority, so If S1 crashes before committing the entries, S5 cannot be elected leader and hence won't overwrite the entries
with indices >= 2. the RequestVote RPC would fail for S5 as RequestVoteRPC #2 would not hold, S5's logs aren't up-to-date
with S1,S2,S2 (i.e. a majority).
