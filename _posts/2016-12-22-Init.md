Hello, there. Its 3:21 A.M right now, I've been at this blogging thing for about 3 hours now.
Truth be told, it was a bit painful setting up my own blog using GitHub Pages. I am keeping my
fingers crossed that this blogging thing better become more regular. I have made myself this promise
several times before. Btw the catchy title was just to mark my entry into this blogging thing.

To tell the reader (If there are any, comment below if you do exist!!), I have been doing a few things lately.
I studied quite a bit of Math and got my basics cemented. I studied [Linear Algebra from here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) and also studied [Statistics 110 from here](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/).
I did this with the express intention of strengthening my Math background for studying Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and the
like. Suffice to say, it helped tremendously. And I would gladly suggest this to anyone planning such an endeavour. I still have
a few things left to study in Statistics though, Beta,Gamma distributions, Markov Chains and Law of Large Numbers. Which Reminds me that I need
to finish them pretty soon. I am also studying [Sheldon Axler](http://www.amazon.in/Linear-Algebra-Done-Right-Axler/dp/8184895321/)
to get a better grip over abstract linear algebra, I bought the hardcover from Amazon and intend to read it cover-to-cover, but alas the progress has been a bit slow on that front.

Lastly, I am also into [Lecture 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLKOQfKLUks&t=49s) of [CS 229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/info.html).
But I think the progress there will slow down a bit, courtesy of the upcoming placement session from Jan 2017. I will keep updating my plans
here. See you soon.
